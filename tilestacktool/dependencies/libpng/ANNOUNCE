Changes since the last public release (1.5.21):

  Regenerated configure scripts with libtool-2.4.4
  Made the check for out-of-range values in png_set_tRNS() detect
    values that are exactly 2^bit_depth, and work on 16-bit platforms.
  Quieted some warnings from Coverity-scan.
  Merged pngtest.c with libpng-1.6.17/pngtest.c
  Display user limits in the output from pngtest.
  Eliminated the PNG_SAFE_LIMITS macro and restored the 1-million-column
    and 1-million-row default limits in pnglibconf.dfa, that can be reset
    by the user at build time or run time.  This provides a more robust
    defense against DOS and as-yet undiscovered overflows.
  Added PNG_WRITE_CUSTOMIZE_COMPRESSION_SUPPORTED macro, on by default.
  Allow user to call png_get_IHDR() with NULL arguments (Reuben Hawkins).
  Rebuilt configure scripts with automake-1.15 and libtool-2.4.6
  Removed some comments that the configure script did not handle
    properly from scripts/pnglibconf.dfa and pnglibconf.h.prebuilt.
  Merged png_free_data() with libpng-1.6.17
  Updated CMakeLists.txt to add OSX framework, change YES/NO to ON/OFF
    for consistency, and remove some useless tests (Alexey Petruchik).
  Remove pnglibconf.h, pnglibconf.c, and pnglibconf.out instead of
    pnglibconf.* in "make clean" (Cosmin).
  Fix incorrect calculation of maximum number of unknown chunks or
    sPLT chunks to be stored (John Bowler).
